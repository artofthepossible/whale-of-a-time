### Using Docker Desktop and the Docker Init Command Lab

Overview
In this lab, you'll learn 
The fundamentals docker init CLI commands to kickstart your containerization process, understand the inputs and outputs.
Learn how to mount a volume in a Docker container to persist data and share files between the host and the container.
Guide you through the process of optimizing your Java application running in a Docker container by modifying Java arguments and entrypoints.

Time to Complete: 5-30 minutes

### How to Use This Hands-On Lab
1. You have installed the latest version of Docker Desktop.
2. You have installed a Git client.
3. You have an IDE or a text editor to edit files. Docker recommends using Visual Studio Code.
4. Clone the getting-started-app repository using the following command:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/artofthepossible/whale-of-a-time
```


### Overview
Creates Docker-related starter files for your project
Supplies .dockerignore, Dockerfile, and compose.yaml files
Has support for ASP.NET, Java, Go, Node, Python, and Rust


### Steps
### Part 1: Docker Init

```sh
$ docker init
```
Follow prompts

```sh
What application platform does your project use? Java
Whatâ€™s the relative directory (with a leading .) for your app? ./src
What version of Java do you want to use? 21
What port does your server listen on? 8080
```

The command expedites the creation of necessary Docker assets which accelerates the process to dockerize an application saving you time and allowing you to do more</br>

Review the outputs of the artifacts created</br>
Depending on your application, make updates to the multistage dockerfile shared based on your application needs</br>
.dockerignore (a config file that describes files and directories that you want to exclude when building a Docker image)</br>
Dockerfile (a list of commands used to assemble an image.), </br>
compose.yaml ( a file to define multiple container applications)</br>
and  README file </br>

### Part 2: Start your application

```sh
docker compose up --build
```
In your terminal you can use the following commands to bring up Docker Desktop</br>
```sh
$ v View in Docker Desktop
```
**Access the Application**</br>
Your application will be available at http://localhost:8080

### Part 3: Stop your application 

```sh
docker compose down
```

### Part 4: Mounting a Volume in a Docker Container
Objective: Learn how to mount a volume in a Docker container to persist data and share files between the host and the container.</br>

To enhance your existing Spring Boot application to allow an end user to mount a volume for logs, you can follow these steps:</br>

This setup ensures that logs written to /tmp/logs inside the container are persisted on the host machine in the ./logs directory.</br>

Dockerfile: Add VOLUME /tmp/logs to define the volume.</br>
Docker Compose: Map the volume in docker-compose.yml to link the host directory to the container directory.</br>


Modify the Application Properties</br>

Update your application.properties file to specify the log file location. </br>This will allow you to direct logs to a specific directory that can be mounted as a volume.</br>

```sh
# filepath: /whale-of-a-time/src/main/resources/application.properties
logging.file.path=/tmp/logs
```
To include a volume for /tmp/logs in your Dockerfile and Docker Compose file, you can follow these steps:</br>

**Dockerfile Update**</br>
Add the VOLUME /tmp/logs instruction to your Dockerfile. This will create a mount point with the specified path and mark it as </br>holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other containers.</br>
```sh
# ...existing code...

FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre-jammy AS final

# Create a non-privileged user that the app will run under.
# See https://docs.docker.com/go/dockerfile-user-best-practices/
ARG UID=10001
RUN adduser \
    --disabled-password \
    --gecos "" \
    --home "/nonexistent" \
    --shell "/sbin/nologin" \
    --no-create-home \
    --uid "${UID}" \
    appuser
USER appuser

# Copy the executable from the "package" stage.
COPY --from=extract build/target/extracted/dependencies/ ./
COPY --from=extract build/target/extracted/spring-boot-loader/ ./
COPY --from=extract build/target/extracted/snapshot-dependencies/ ./
COPY --from=extract build/target/extracted/application/ ./

# Define the volume
VOLUME /tmp/logs

EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT [ "java", "org.springframework.boot.loader.launch.JarLauncher" ]
```

**Docker Compose File Update**</br>
Update your docker-compose.yml file to include the volume definition and mount it to the container.
```sh
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./logs:/tmp/logs
```


### Part 5: Optimizing Java Application
This section will guide you through the process of optimizing your Java application running in a Docker container by modifying Java arguments and entrypoints.</br>
By adjusting environment variables and JVM options, you can enhance the performance and behavior of your application.</br>

**Entrypoint**</br>
Java arguments and entrypoints are configurations that control how your Java application runs inside a Docker container. </br>These configurations include setting heap sizes, garbage collection options, and other JVM parameters that can impact the performance and behavior of your application.</br>


**Why**</br>
Optimizing Java arguments and entrypoints can provide several benefits:

**Performance**: Properly configured JVM options can improve the performance of your application by optimizing memory usage and garbage collection.</br>
**Resource Management**: Setting appropriate heap sizes ensures that your application uses the right amount of memory, preventing out-of-memory errors and reducing resource wastage.</br>
**Stability**: Fine-tuning JVM options can lead to a more stable application by avoiding common pitfalls such as long garbage collection pauses.</br>

Follow these steps to optimize your Java application:</br>

Set Environment Variables for Java Options: Add the ENV JAVA_OPTS line to your Dockerfile to set useful Java options such as initial and maximum heap size, garbage collector, and entropy source.</br>

Define the Entrypoint: Modify the ENTRYPOINT to include the JAVA_OPTS environment variable, allowing you to pass JVM arguments when starting the application.</br>

**Access the Application**</br>
Your application will be available at: 

```sh

```

### Best Practices

**Avoid Running as Root User**</br>
Running containers as the root user can pose security risks. Ensure that your Dockerfile creates and uses a non-privileged user to run the application.</br>

**No Secrets/Credentials/Keys in Dockerfile**</br>
Avoid hardcoding secrets, credentials, or keys in your Dockerfile. Use environment variables or Secrets Managers to manage sensitive information securely.</br>

**Use Docker Scout to Assess Image for Vulnerabilities**</br>
Docker Scout helps you identify and fix vulnerabilities in your Docker images. Use the following command to scan your image for vulnerabilities:</br>

**Access the Application**</br>
Navigate to the resource usage extenstion to Monitor and manage live data stream for running containers.</br>

To simulate some traffic to the container</br>
This command will continuously send requests to the application every second.</br>

```sh
while true; do curl http://localhost:8080/; sleep 1; done
```

**Stop your Application**</br>
```sh
docker compose down
```
