### Part 3: Discover Docker Desktop
Here's a guided tour of Docker Desktop based on the provided knowledge sources:</br>

Docker Desktop is an all-in-one application for Mac, Linux, or Windows that allows you to build, share, and run containerized applications and microservices. </br>
It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for managing containers, applications, and images directly from your machine.</br>

When you open Docker Desktop, you'll see the Docker Desktop Dashboard, which offers several key views:</br>

**Containers view**: This provides a runtime view of all your containers and applications. </br>
You can interact with containers, manage their lifecycle, and perform common actions. </br>

**Images view**: Here you can see a list of your Docker images, run images as containers, pull the latest versions from Docker Hub, and inspect images. </br>
It also shows image vulnerabilities and clean-up options. </br>

**Volumes view**: This displays a list of volumes and allows you to create, delete, and see which ones are being used. </br>

**Builds view**: You can inspect your build history and manage builders here. </br>

The Dashboard also provides access to:</br>

**Settings menu** for configuring Docker Desktop</br>
Troubleshoot menu for debugging and performing restart operations</br>

**Notifications center** for updates and other information</br>
**Learning center** with quick in-app walkthroughs and resources</br>

**Quick Search** is A key feature of Docker Desktop that is located in the Dashboard header. </br>
This allows you to search for containers, images, extensions, volumes, and even Docker documentation. </br>
