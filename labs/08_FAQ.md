### Where can I subscribe for New Features and Updates?
New users can subscribe to get new features and updates from Docker by following these steps:</br>

Create a Docker Account: If you're new to Docker, you'll need to create an account. You can do this by visiting the Docker Hub signup page⁠.</br>

Subscribe to the Docker Newsletter: This is a great way to stay informed about the latest updates, features, and best practices. You can subscribe to the newsletter by visiting the Docker Newsletter Subscription page⁠.</br>

Authenticate and Update: To receive the newest Docker Desktop features according to your subscription level, you should authenticate and update your Docker Desktop.</br> 

By following these steps, new users can ensure they receive the latest updates and features from Docker.</br> For more detailed information, you can always refer to the official Docker documentation⁠.</br>

### How to deploy a container using a Helm chart and Terraform.</br>
To deploy a container using a Helm chart and Terraform, you can follow these general</br> steps. This approach leverages Helm for Kubernetes package management and Terraform for infrastructure provisioning. Here's a high-level guide:</br>

**1. Prepare Your Container and Helm Chart**</br>
Container: Ensure your container image is built and pushed to a container registry </br>(e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, etc.).</br>
Helm Chart: Make sure your Helm chart is ready. It should define the Kubernetes </br>resources needed to run your application.</br>

**2. Set Up Terraform**</br>
Install Terraform: Make sure Terraform is installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Terraform website⁠.
Configure Provider: Set up the Terraform provider for your cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure). This involves setting up authentication and any necessary configurations.

**3. Create Terraform Modules**</br>
Infrastructure Module: Create a Terraform module to provision the necessary </br>infrastructure. This might include:</br>
Kubernetes cluster (if not already existing)</br>
Networking resources (VPCs, subnets, etc.)</br>
IAM roles and policies (if using AWS)</br>
Helm Module: Create a Terraform module to deploy your Helm chart. You can use the Terraform Helm provider⁠ to manage Helm charts.</br>

**4. Write Terraform Configuration**</br>
Main Configuration: Write a main.tf file that uses your modules. This file should:</br>
Call the infrastructure module to set up the environment.</br>
Use the Helm module to deploy your application using the Helm chart.</br>

**5. Deploy with Terraform**
Initialize Terraform: Run terraform init to initialize your Terraform configuration.</br>
Plan Deployment: Use terraform plan to see what changes will be made.</br>
Apply Configuration: Run terraform apply to provision the infrastructure and deploy your application.</br>

**6. Verify Deployment**
Check Kubernetes: Use kubectl to verify that your application is running in the Kubernetes cluster.</br>
Monitor Resources: Ensure all resources are created as expected and monitor for any issues.</br>

**7. Manage and Update**
Update Helm Chart: If you need to update your application, modify the Helm chart and reapply with Terraform.</br>
Scale and Maintain: Use Terraform to manage scaling and updates to your infrastructure and application.</br>

[Helm Documentation⁠] (https://helm.sh/docs/)</br>

This approach provides a robust way to manage both your infrastructure and application deployments using Terraform and Helm.</br>
